# Backend Application with CSAPP CLI

## Description
This project is a Node.js backend application created with the CSAPP CLI. You can choose between TypeScript or JavaScript during setup, and it comes with a predefined folder structure, environment configurations, and Prettier formatting.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

2. **Development mode**:
   Start the development server using `npm run dev`. This will run the app in development mode with Nodemon (for automatic restarts).

3. **Build the project**:
   If using TypeScript, build the project with `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript files. (Note: A build script can be added if necessary.)

4. **Start the application**:
   Run `npm start` to start the app in production mode.

## Scripts
- `npm start`: Starts the application using `node src/index.js` or `src/index.ts`.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the app in development mode using Nodemon.
- `npm run build`: (If TypeScript) Builds the app for production.

## Environment Variables
